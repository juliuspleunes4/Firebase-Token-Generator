# Firebase Service Account Token Generator

---

## This repository provides a Python script to generate an Access Token for Firebase services using a Service Account JSON key. Access tokens are essential for authenticating and interacting with Firebase services via REST APIs or other tools.

## Overview

Firebase services require an access token for authentication when performing operations outside the Firebase Admin SDK. This script simplifies the process of generating OAuth 2.0 access tokens using a service account key file.
It leverages the google-auth library to interact with Google Cloud's authentication system and allows you to request an access token for specific scopes.

## Features

- Easy-to-use Python script to generate access tokens.
- Supports custom OAuth 2.0 scopes.
